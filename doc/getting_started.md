## From the console ##
To run a game of MiniZork, run the ZConsole.dart app, either from the VM in shell,
or from the Dart Editor (user-input works in the Dart Editor console too).

You can change the game file within ZConsole.dart or you can run it form the 
command line with an arguement:

    dart ZConsole.dart path/to/minizork.z3
